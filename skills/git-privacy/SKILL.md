# Git Privacy Skill

**MANDATORY**: Prevents AI attribution in all git operations by default.

## What This Blocks

This skill blocks **attribution patterns** - indicators that AI authored or generated code:

### Co-Authored-By Lines
```
Co-Authored-By: <any AI model or tool>
Co-authored-by: <any email>
```

### Generated-With Footers
```
Generated with [Tool Name](https://...)
🤖 Generated with [Tool]
Generated by AI
```

### Tool URL Attribution
```
claude.com/claude-code
anthropic.com
openai.com
```

## What This Does NOT Block

Legitimate AI-related feature work is allowed:

| Allowed | Why |
|---------|-----|
| "feat: Add GPT-4 integration" | Describes a feature |
| "fix: AI inference performance issue" | Describes a bug fix |
| "refactor: Improve ML pipeline" | Describes refactoring |
| "docs: Update AI model configuration" | Describes documentation |

## When Applied

- Git commit operations
- Pull request creation (`gh pr create`)
- PR title and body content
- Branch naming (if contains attribution patterns)

## Default Behavior

**Enforced by default.** To disable, set in `ica.config.json`:
```json
{
  "git": {
    "privacy": false
  }
}
```

## Professional Message Standards

Commit messages must:
- Use clear, descriptive subject lines
- Focus on what changed, not how it was created
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate
- Never include authorship attribution

## Self-Check Before Git Operations

Before every commit or PR, verify:
1. No `Co-Authored-By:` lines present
2. No "Generated with" footers
3. No AI tool URLs in attribution context
4. Message focuses on what changed, not how

## Integration

Works with:
- commit-pr skill - Commit and PR formatting
- branch-protection skill - Branch safety rules
- process skill - Development workflow phases
